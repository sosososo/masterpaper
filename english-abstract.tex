With the continuous development of computer vision and machine learning,
something has been changed.
In the field of computer vision and machine learning, object detection is a very classical and basic subject, while defect detection is a very important application field of it. 
The traditional object detection algorithm mainly involves two steps. First, the features artificial designed in the image are extracted, then the classifier with the features as input is used to classify the image. There are two main disadvantages int this type of method, one of them is the difficulty of feature engineering, another is that the performance of the classification model is susceptible to the textures ot the part, lighting, noises, and other conditions.
With the vigorous development of deep learning, more and more different detection models have been developed to detect object, which have achieved ideal results in many fields, especially in competitions. 
However, those models always demand a mountain of samples and is not good at detecting little object while most of defections are very small.

To solve this problem, this paper takes the normal map as the input of defect detection for the first time. We do the defect detecion with a traditional method combined SVM, Adaboost and Cascade and get a state-of-the-art performance. We also take the normal map as input as convolutional neural network, and compare the results with traditional method's .
The main work and innovation of this article could be find as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We propose a method to acquire the normal map of parts' surface and  design an equipment to acquire the method's inputs. 
 This equipment includes a camera,LED light bars, a stepper motor and so many other component, 
  we make up those into five models so that the equipment could get required information.
 And we put forward a model to compute the normal map with the inputs collected by our equipment maintained above. To make up the imperfection of the capture equipment, we make some corrections and enhancements before the normal map's computation.
 Those corrections and enhancements include
 color correction, distortion calibration and light compensation.
\item Also, we has experiment on the traditional object detection methods with our normal maps extracted. We extract many diffierent features form the normal map such as haar-like, LBP, GLCM, HOG and others, 
and use those features as the model's input, then we combine those features according to the model's outputs. 
Furthermore, considering rareness of defections on the parts,
we try a variety of ways to get more datas such as rotation and mirroring, considering the imbalance of datas between the parts with defections and those without defection, we divide the dataset into some subdatasets. For each subdatasets, we use the Adaboost method to train a more powerful classifier with the base learner of SVM, then use Cascade to combine those classifier to do defect detection.
\item At last, we make some experiments with deep learning modes. 
First, we use the sliding windows to divide the original normal map into some smaller windows,
and do some data augmentation on those windows. 
We also divide the dataset into some subdatasets and train a model for each subdataset.
We combine those moodels with Cascade to do defection detect.
We also do some analysises on the results and performance of this model compared with traditional methods'.
